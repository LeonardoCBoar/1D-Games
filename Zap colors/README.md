#Uni-Dimensional Games
In this repository are published the 1D games i'm creating with C++ and SFML.
The definition i'm using for a 1D is a game that is done only with a line of squares.

####Tutorial
Every round, 3 colors will be disposed in the Board squares, your goal is to click as fast as possible in the one that has the same color of the Target square. The Time square shows how much time you have to finish the round,the darker it is, more time you have. Finally, the Level square shows in which level you're, the more colored it is, higher is the level you are.
